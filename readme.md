**My project**

Native Java DIP (digital image processing) application

**Current features**

- reading images from anywhere:
    - from local drive
    - from URLs
- some kinds of pics processing:
    - greyscale
    - sepia
    - negative
    - custom processing (influencing on red, green or blue channels)
    - pics rotating (on 90 grads)
    - pics vertical and horizontal mirroring
- selecting, selective processing and pics-cropping
- drag-and-drop feature support
    - drag and drop an image from everywhere to process it 
- adding labels and captions on image
- saving processed image

**Future features**

- different types of pics processing
    - ...
- dealing with scalability of image
- different types of filters (gaussian, box etc)
    - making image blurred
    - filtering image
- operations with brightness and contrast
- ...

**Bugs those should be fixed** 
- some .png pics cannot be opened via using ctrl+v hot-keys
- signs on large images aren't scalable
- too slow on extra large pics!!!

**Necessary info about OpenCV set-up**
 
This project could use OpenCV libraries, but their using is temporary stopped.
